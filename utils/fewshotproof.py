Q: Let S ⊆ ℝⁿ be an open convex set and f: S → ℝ be a twice differentiable function. Then f is convex on S if and only if its Hessian matrix ∇²f(x) is positive semi-definite for all x ∈ S.

A: Proof:

(Necessity)

Assume that f is convex on the open convex set S. Let x̂ ∈ S and let x ∈ ℝⁿ.

Since S is open, for sufficiently small λ ≠ 0, the point x̂ + λx ∈ S.

By the first-order condition for convexity (Theorem 3), we have:

(1) f(x̂ + λx) ≥ f(x̂) + λ∇f(x̂)ᵀx

By Taylor's theorem (second-order expansion):

(2) f(x̂ + λx) = f(x̂) + λ∇f(x̂)ᵀx + (1/2)λ² xᵀ∇²f(x̂)x + λ²α(x̂, λx)

Substitute (2) into (1):

 f(x̂) + λ∇f(x̂)ᵀx + (1/2)λ² xᵀ∇²f(x̂)x + λ²α(x̂, λx) ≥ f(x̂) + λ∇f(x̂)ᵀx

Cancel common terms, divide by λ² > 0, and take the limit λ → 0:

 (1/2) xᵀ∇²f(x̂)x + α(x̂, λx) ≥ 0 → xᵀ∇²f(x̂)x ≥ 0

So ∇²f(x̂) is positive semi-definite for all x̂ ∈ S.

(Sufficiency)

Assume ∇²f(x) is positive semi-definite for all x ∈ S. Let x̂, x ∈ S.

By the multivariate mean value theorem, there exists x̃ = λx̂ + (1−λ)x for some λ ∈ (0, 1) such that:

(3) f(x) = f(x̂) + ∇f(x̂)ᵀ(x − x̂) + (1/2)(x − x̂)ᵀ∇²f(x̃)(x − x̂)

Since ∇²f(x̃) is positive semi-definite, the final term is ≥ 0.

Thus:

 f(x) ≥ f(x̂) + ∇f(x̂)ᵀ(x − x̂)

This satisfies the first-order condition for convexity.

Hence, f is convex on S.

□

Summary:
A function f: S → ℝ is convex on an open convex set S ⊆ ℝⁿ iff ∇²f(x) ⪰ 0 (i.e., is positive semi-definite) for all x ∈ S.

    The following is a formal proof written in the style of a mathematics textbook. It uses clear logic, rigorous steps, and proper notation to prove the equivalence between function convexity and the convexity of its epigraph.

Q: Theorem — A function f: S → ℝ is convex on a convex set S ⊆ ℝⁿ if and only if its epigraph is a convex subset of ℝⁿ⁺¹.

A: Proof:

Let f: S → ℝ and let the epigraph of f be defined as:

  epi(f) = { (x, α) ∈ ℝⁿ⁺¹ | x ∈ S and f(x) ≤ α }

We will prove both directions.

---

(Necessity)  
Assume f is convex on S.

Let (x, α), (u, β) ∈ epi(f). That is,  
 x, u ∈ S and f(x) ≤ α, f(u) ≤ β

Let λ ∈ [0, 1]. Define:

 z = λx + (1−λ)u

Since S is convex and x, u ∈ S, it follows that z ∈ S.

Using the convexity of f:

 f(z) = f(λx + (1−λ)u) ≤ λf(x) + (1−λ)f(u)  
                    ≤ λ α + (1−λ) β

So:

 (z, λα + (1−λ)β) ∈ epi(f)

Hence, for any two points in epi(f), their convex combination lies in epi(f).

Therefore, epi(f) is a convex set.

---

(Sufficiency)  
Assume epi(f) is a convex subset of ℝⁿ⁺¹.

Let x, u ∈ S. Then:  
 (x, f(x)) ∈ epi(f), (u, f(u)) ∈ epi(f)

Since epi(f) is convex, for any λ ∈ [0, 1], the point

 (λx + (1−λ)u, λf(x) + (1−λ)f(u)) ∈ epi(f)

So:

 f(λx + (1−λ)u) ≤ λf(x) + (1−λ)f(u)

Thus, f is convex on S.

□

Q: Prove that √2 is irrational using contradiction.

A: Proof (By Contradiction):

Assume, for contradiction, that √2 is rational.

Then there exist integers a and b with no common factors such that:

 √2 = a / b  (b ≠ 0, and the fraction is in lowest terms)

Squaring both sides:

 2 = a² / b² ⇒ a² = 2b²

This implies that a² is even ⇒ a must be even (since the square of an odd number is odd).

So, let a = 2k for some integer k.

Then:

 a² = (2k)² = 4k²  
 ⇒ 4k² = 2b²  
 ⇒ b² = 2k²

This implies b² is even ⇒ b is also even.

Hence, both a and b are even, contradicting the assumption that a/b is in lowest terms.

Therefore, our assumption was false, and √2 is irrational.

📘 Terms:
- **Rational number**: Can be expressed as a/b where a, b ∈ ℤ, b ≠ 0.
- **Irrational**: Cannot be written as a ratio of integers.

Q: Prove that the sum of the first n natural numbers Prove by induction: ∑ₖ₌₁ⁿ k = n(n+1)/2

A: Proof (By Induction):

Let P(n): 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2

**Base Case (n = 1):**  
 LHS = 1  
 RHS = 1(1 + 1)/2 = 1  
 ⇒ P(1) is true.

**Inductive Hypothesis:**  
Assume P(k) is true for some k ∈ ℕ:

 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k + 1)/2

**Inductive Step (k → k+1):**  
We must show:

 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)/2

LHS = [k(k + 1)/2] + (k + 1) = (k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1)) / 2  
  = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2 = RHS

Hence, P(k+1) is true.

By induction, the formula holds for all n ∈ ℕ.

Q: Prove that if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C, then A ⊆ C.

A: Proof:

Let A, B, C be sets.

Assume A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C.

Let x ∈ A.  
Then since A ⊆ B ⇒ x ∈ B  
And since B ⊆ C ⇒ x ∈ C

Therefore, x ∈ C. Since x was arbitrary, A ⊆ C.

Q: Let f: S ⊆ ℝⁿ → ℝ be differentiable on an open convex set S. Prove that f is convex on S if and only if:
  f(x) − f(u) ≥ (x − u)ᵀ∇f(u), ∀ x, u ∈ S.

A: Proof:

---

(Necessity)

Assume f is convex on S.  
Let x, u ∈ S and let λ ∈ [0, 1].

By the definition of convexity:

 f(λx + (1 − λ)u) ≤ λf(x) + (1 − λ)f(u)    ...(1)

Rewriting:

 f(x) − f(u) ≥ [f(x) − f(λx + (1 − λ)u)] / λ   ...(2)

Now since f is differentiable on S, we apply the **first-order Taylor approximation**:

 f(u + w) = f(u) + wᵀ∇f(u) + α(u, w)‖w‖, where lim_{‖w‖ → 0} α(u, w) = 0.

Let w = λ(x − u), so:

 f(λx + (1 − λ)u) = f(u + λ(x − u))  
  = f(u) + λ(x − u)ᵀ∇f(u) + α(u, λ(x − u))‖λ(x − u)‖  ...(3)

Substitute (3) into (1):

 f(x) − f(u) ≥ λ(x − u)ᵀ∇f(u) + α(u, λ(x − u))‖λ(x − u)‖

Divide by λ and take the limit as λ → 0:  
 lim_{λ→0} α(u, λ(x − u))‖λ(x − u)‖ = 0

Thus:

 f(x) − f(u) ≥ (x − u)ᵀ∇f(u)

---

(Sufficiency)

Now assume: f(x) − f(u) ≥ (x − u)ᵀ∇f(u), ∀ x, u ∈ S  ...(∗)

Let x, u ∈ S and define: x\* = λx + (1 − λ)u for some λ ∈ [0, 1]

Then:

 f(x) ≥ f(x\*) + (x − x\*)ᵀ∇f(x\*)    ...(4)  
 f(u) ≥ f(x\*) + (u − x\*)ᵀ∇f(x\*)    ...(5)

Multiply (4) by λ and (5) by (1 − λ), and add:

 λf(x) + (1 − λ)f(u) ≥ f(x\*) + [λ(x − x\*) + (1 − λ)(u − x\*)]ᵀ∇f(x\*)

But note:

 λ(x − x\*) + (1 − λ)(u − x\*) = 0  
 ⇒ Inner product term = 0

Therefore:

 λf(x) + (1 − λ)f(u) ≥ f(x\*) = f(λx + (1 − λ)u)

Thus, f satisfies the definition of convexity.

□

📘 Technical Terms:
- **Differentiable function**: A function with continuous first derivative on its domain.
- **Convex function**: f is convex if f(λx + (1−λ)u) ≤ λf(x) + (1−λ)f(u)
- **First-order condition for convexity**: f(x) − f(u) ≥ (x − u)ᵀ∇f(u) is necessary and sufficient for convexity on open convex sets.

Q: Theorem: The feasible region defined by a system of linear inequalities is a convex set.

Statement: Let S = { x ∈ ℝⁿ | Ax ≤ b } be the feasible region defined by matrix A ∈ ℝ^(m×n) and vector b ∈ ℝ^m. Then S is convex.

A: Proof:

Step 1: Define two arbitrary points in the feasible region.

Assume x, y ∈ S, so Ax ≤ b and Ay ≤ b.

Step 2: Take a convex combination of x and y.

For any λ ∈ [0,1], define z = λx + (1-λ)y.

Step 3: Show z satisfies the constraints.

By linearity, Az = A(λx + (1-λ)y) = λAx + (1-λ)Ay ≤ λb + (1-λ)b = b.

Step 4: Conclusion.

Since Az ≤ b, z ∈ S. Hence, S is convex.

Summary:

- Feasible region: the set of points satisfying linear inequalities.  
- Convex set: contains all line segments between points in the set.  
- Convex combination: weighted average where weights sum to 1 and are non-negative.  
- Linearity of matrix multiplication is used to prove convexity.
